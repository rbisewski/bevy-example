# Bevy engine, a simple example

A simple example demonstrating sprites, cameras, and keyboard/mouse input. It
was written in Rust and using Bevy game engine.

This repo exists since good tutorials of bevy are hard to find, which may make
it difficult for new programmers to want to consider using bevy.

Hopefully whomever reads the code in the repo finds it helpful :)
